## Wash Your Shoes: How To Clean Them In The Washer

Do your favorite sneakers look dirty? Are you tired of scrubbing shoes by hand? Many people wonder if their washing machine can handle dirty footwear. Cleaning shoes in the washer is possible and often very effective. This guide helps you understand how to safely clean shoes in the washer. We cover proper preparation, the best machine settings, and crucial drying steps.

This article shows you the simple steps to refresh your footwear. We will discuss which shoes are safe for machine washing and which are not. You will learn about pre-treating stains, choosing the right detergent, and the importance of air drying. Follow these tips to get clean shoes without damage. I will share my best practices for achieving sparkling results.

### Takeaway

*   **Check Shoe Material:** Only machine-wash shoes made from canvas, nylon, or synthetic materials.
*   **Pre-Clean Thoroughly:** Remove loose dirt and debris before washing.
*   **Prepare Your Shoes:** Remove laces and insoles; place shoes in a mesh laundry bag.
*   **Use Cold Water:** Always select a cold water, gentle, or delicate cycle.
*   **Air Dry Completely:** Never use a machine dryer for shoes; air dry away from direct heat.

You can clean shoes in the washer if they are made of synthetic materials, canvas, or nylon. First, remove laces and insoles. Place shoes and a few towels in a mesh bag. Wash on a cold, delicate cycle with mild detergent. Air dry them completely afterward.

### Can You Safely Wash Shoes in the Washer?

Many shoe owners ask about washing machine safety for footwear. The answer depends heavily on the shoe's material. Most athletic shoes, sneakers, and casual canvas shoes can go in the washing machine. These shoes typically use durable synthetic fabrics, nylon, or cotton canvas. Their construction holds up well to the gentle agitation of a washer.

However, not all shoes are suitable for this method. Delicate materials like leather, suede, silk, or satin will suffer damage. The water and detergent can stain, shrink, or ruin these sensitive fabrics. Shoes with embellishments, glued-on parts, or intricate designs also pose a risk. The washing process can loosen glue, causing parts to fall off or break. Always check the shoe's care label if it has one. If no label exists, consider the material carefully before proceeding. My experience shows that choosing the right shoes for the washer prevents disappointment.

#### Identifying Washable Shoe Materials

Knowing which materials can withstand a machine wash is important. Many common shoe types are machine-friendly. Canvas shoes, like popular trainers, are excellent candidates. Their strong cotton weave handles water and detergent well. Nylon running shoes also clean up nicely in the machine. Synthetic mesh athletic shoes are another good option.

You can typically wash fabric sneakers made from polyester or similar materials. These materials resist water damage and maintain their shape. Before you wash, inspect the stitching and overall condition. Shoes that are already falling apart might not survive the wash. A few stitches loose are okay, but major rips will only worsen. Trust me, I have put many pairs through this test.

#### Types of Shoes to Avoid Washing Machine

Some shoes should never go near a washing machine. Leather shoes, including dress shoes and boots, will dry out, crack, and lose their shape. Water causes leather to become stiff and damaged. Suede is another material that cannot be machine washed. Water will stain suede and alter its texture permanently. If you need to clean scuff marks from specialized footwear, like patent leather shoes, a different method is needed. [Cleaning patent leather shoes with scuff marks](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-patent-leather-shoes-with-scuff-marks) requires specific care.

Shoes with delicate embellishments, such as beads, sequins, or glued-on glitter, are also off-limits. The machine's agitation will likely dislodge these decorations. Additionally, shoes with memory foam insoles might not dry properly. The foam can absorb too much water and stay damp, leading to mold or odor. Wool-lined shoes can shrink if washed incorrectly. Stick to hand-cleaning or professional services for these fragile items.

### Preparing Your Shoes for a Washer Clean

Proper preparation makes a big difference in how your shoes turn out. Skipping these steps can lead to poor cleaning or damage. Start by removing any large chunks of dirt or debris. This protects your washing machine from unnecessary grit. You also need to tackle stains and odors before they set in. Taking a few extra minutes here ensures a much better result.

Getting your shoes ready means more than just a quick brush-off. It involves careful attention to laces and insoles. These small parts hold a surprising amount of dirt. I always perform these steps, as they make the washing process far more effective. A clean start means a clean finish for your footwear.

#### Removing Debris and Loose Dirt

Before washing, remove all loose dirt from your shoes. Use a stiff brush or old toothbrush to scrub away mud, gravel, and surface grime. Pay attention to the soles and crevices where dirt hides. Knock the shoes together outside to dislodge stubborn debris. This step prevents dirt from spreading inside your washing machine. It also helps the detergent work more efficiently.

You can use a wet cloth to wipe down rubber parts. This helps remove any sticky residue or surface stains. I sometimes use a small stick or scraper to clean out the deep treads. This ensures that only the fabric needs deep cleaning in the washer. This simple effort saves your machine from excess dirt and helps the shoes get truly clean.

#### Tackling Stains and Odors

Address any visible stains before putting shoes in the washer. For general grime, a spot cleaner or a paste of baking soda and a little water works well. Apply the paste, let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then gently scrub with a brush. For tough stains, you can use a small amount of laundry pre-treater. For specific challenges, like cleaning white shoes, [cleaning white shoes with hydrogen peroxide](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-white-shoes-with-hydrogen-peroxide) offers a powerful solution.

Odor is a common problem with worn shoes. You can sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight. This helps absorb bad smells. For persistent odors, consider a solution of vinegar and baking soda. You can make a paste to scrub the inside or outside of the shoes. For detailed cleaning of the inside of your shoes, including odor removal, check out this guide on [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes). This pre-treatment step is crucial for achieving truly fresh shoes.

#### Securing Laces and Inserts

Always remove shoe laces and insoles before washing. Laces can get tangled around the agitator in a top-loading machine. They can also get caught in the drain pump, causing damage. You can wash laces separately in a mesh laundry bag. I usually just hand-wash them with a little soap and water.

Insoles also need special attention. Many insoles are made of foam or cardboard, which can fall apart in the wash. Even if washable, they often absorb too much water. This makes drying difficult and can lead to mildew. It's best to hand-wash insoles with soap and water or simply wipe them down. If they are very smelly, let them air out completely. Place them in a sunny spot to dry.

### Choosing The Right Washer Settings For Your Shoes

The correct washer settings prevent damage to your shoes and your machine. You do not want to use hot water or aggressive cycles. Harsh settings can warp shoe materials or cause colors to bleed. My goal is always to be gentle but effective. This means choosing the right temperature and cycle.

Proper detergent use and balancing the load are also vital. Too much detergent can leave residue on your shoes. An unbalanced load can cause the washing machine to vibrate excessively. I have learned through trial and error that these small details matter greatly. Paying attention to these settings ensures a successful shoe wash.

#### Water Temperature and Cycle Selection

Always use cold water when washing shoes. Hot water can cause glues to melt, fabrics to shrink, or colors to fade. Cold water is much safer for most shoe materials. It helps maintain the shoe's shape and integrity. I always select the cold water option on my machine.

For the wash cycle, choose the "delicate" or "gentle" setting. This cycle uses less agitation and a slower spin speed. Less vigorous movement protects your shoes from harsh banging against the machine drum. It also prevents the shoes from stretching or deforming. If your machine has a "hand wash" setting, that is an even gentler option. This gentle approach ensures your shoes stay intact.

#### Detergent Use and Load Balance

Use a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid powdered detergents, as they may not dissolve completely. This can leave white residue on your shoes. A small amount of detergent is usually enough, about half of what you would use for a regular load of clothes. Too much soap can be hard to rinse out. This leaves shoes feeling stiff or sticky.

To balance the load, add a few old towels to the washer drum. These towels act as cushioning for the shoes. They prevent the shoes from banging around too much. The towels also help absorb some of the impact noise. I usually throw in two to four old towels. This balances the load and protects both the shoes and the machine. It ensures a smoother wash cycle.

### A Step-by-Step Guide to Washing Shoes In The Machine

Washing your shoes in the machine is a straightforward process once you know the steps. Following these instructions will give you the best results. I find that a systematic approach reduces any guesswork. Each step builds on the last, ensuring thorough cleaning. This guide simplifies the entire procedure.

This method is reliable for most machine-washable footwear. From preparing your shoes to starting the cycle, every detail matters. I will walk you through each action, providing clear instructions. Let's get your shoes sparkling clean again with minimal effort. This process helps extend the life of your favorite pairs.

1.  **Prepare Your Shoes:** First, remove laces and insoles from your shoes. Use a stiff brush or old toothbrush to scrub off loose dirt, mud, and debris from the outside and soles. For tough stains, apply a pre-treatment or a paste of baking soda and water. Address any odors with baking soda or a vinegar solution inside the shoes. You can learn more about how to use cleaning solutions for specific areas like the inside of shoes by checking our guide on [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes). This preparation helps the machine do its job better.
2.  **Place in a Mesh Bag:** Put your prepared shoes into a mesh laundry bag. This bag protects the shoes from banging around inside the machine. It also prevents laces or other small parts from getting tangled. If you do not have a mesh bag, an old pillowcase tied securely at the top can work as a substitute. I always use a mesh bag for my shoes.
3.  **Add Towels:** Place two to four old towels into the washing machine drum. These towels serve two purposes. They provide cushioning, which reduces the noise and impact of the shoes hitting the drum. They also help balance the wash load. This prevents the machine from becoming off-kilter during the spin cycle. The towels help absorb excess water, too.
4.  **Add Detergent:** Pour a small amount of mild liquid laundry detergent into the dispenser. About half the amount you would use for a regular load is enough. Avoid using too much soap. Too much detergent can leave a residue on your shoes. I prefer liquid detergent as it dissolves easily.
5.  **Select Cycle and Temperature:** Set your washing machine to a "delicate" or "gentle" cycle. Always choose cold water. Hot water can damage the shoes' materials or glues. A slow spin speed is also ideal to minimize agitation. This gentle approach is key to preserving your shoes.
6.  **Start the Wash:** Close the washer door and start the cycle. Allow the machine to complete the entire wash and spin cycle. Resist the urge to open the door mid-cycle. Let the machine do its work without interruption. For general washing machine tips, you can often apply principles found in guides like [how to wash bathroom mats in washer](https://www.homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-wash-bathroom-mats-in-washer), which highlights gentle cycles and cold water use.
7.  **Remove and Prepare for Drying:** Once the cycle finishes, remove your shoes promptly from the washer. Do not let them sit in the machine for too long. They can develop odors if left damp. Give them a quick shake to remove excess water. You are now ready for the critical drying step.

### Drying Your Shoes After Washing For Best Results

Drying shoes properly after washing is as important as the wash itself. Incorrect drying methods can cause shrinkage, warping, or even damage to materials. The goal is to dry them completely but gently. This prevents odors, mold, and structural problems. I cannot stress enough the importance of air drying.

The machine dryer is your enemy here. High heat is detrimental to almost all shoe materials. It melts glues, shrinks fabrics, and deforms plastic components. Taking your time with the drying process ensures your shoes maintain their original shape and last longer. I always prioritize air drying for all my machine-washed footwear.

#### Air Drying Techniques

Air drying is the safest and most effective method for shoes. Start by stuffing your washed shoes with white paper towels or newspaper. The paper absorbs excess moisture and helps the shoes keep their shape. Change the paper every few hours, or as it becomes damp. This speeds up the drying process. Do not use colored newspaper as the ink can transfer to your shoes.

Place your shoes in a well-ventilated area. A sunny spot outdoors is ideal if the weather permits. Ensure there is good airflow around them. If drying indoors, choose a room with good air circulation. You can place them near a fan, but avoid direct heat sources like radiators or heaters. These can still cause damage or shrinkage. I often prop my shoes up so air can circulate inside them.

#### Avoiding The Dryer

Never put your shoes in a machine dryer. The high heat from a dryer can cause irreparable damage. It can melt the adhesives that hold shoes together. This leads to soles separating from the upper. The heat also shrinks synthetic materials and can warp the shape of the shoes. Even a low heat setting is too risky.

Tumble drying can also cause shoes to bang violently inside the dryer drum. This noise is annoying, and it can damage the dryer itself. It can also damage the shoes' structure. Even for seemingly durable sneakers, the dryer is a no-go. Patience is key when drying. Allow shoes to air dry for at least 24-48 hours. They must be completely dry before you wear them again.

### Keeping Shoes Clean: After the Washer

Washing your shoes in the machine is a great way to refresh them. However, maintaining that cleanliness extends their life and keeps them looking good. Regular care reduces the need for frequent deep washes. I focus on preventing dirt buildup and addressing issues promptly. This makes a big difference in the long run.

Think of it as routine maintenance for your footwear. Small actions can prevent big cleaning jobs later. Spot cleaning, odor prevention, and protection methods are all part of this. These tips help keep your shoes fresh and ready for wear. My shoes stay cleaner for longer with these simple habits.

#### Regular Spot Cleaning

Address small stains and dirt as soon as they appear. Do not wait for them to become embedded. A damp cloth with a little mild soap can remove most surface marks. For scuff marks on rubber soles, a magic eraser works wonders. This quick action prevents stains from setting. It keeps your shoes looking tidy between major washes.

You can also use a soft brush to remove dust and light dirt after each wear. Brushing off debris takes only a few seconds. This simple habit keeps your shoes from accumulating grime. I do this regularly, and it saves me from bigger cleaning tasks. Consistent spot cleaning helps your shoes stay presentable.

#### Odor Prevention Strategies

Odor often develops from moisture and bacteria inside shoes. To prevent this, always allow your shoes to air out completely after wearing them. Do not store them in a dark, damp closet immediately after use. Remove insoles if they get particularly sweaty. This allows better airflow.

Sprinkling baking soda inside your shoes when not in use helps absorb moisture and odors. You can leave it overnight and then shake it out. Shoe deodorizers or cedar shoe trees also help keep shoes fresh. Cedar wood absorbs moisture and has a natural, pleasant scent. I use cedar shoe trees in my frequently worn pairs.

#### Protecting Your Washed Footwear

Once your shoes are clean and dry, consider applying a protective spray. Water-resistant or stain-resistant sprays create a barrier on the shoe's surface. This helps repel water and prevent new stains from soaking in. These sprays are available for various materials, including canvas and synthetic fabrics. Always test the spray on an inconspicuous area first.

Store your shoes in a clean, dry place away from direct sunlight. This prevents material breakdown and discoloration. If you have white shoes, keeping them in a cool, dark place can help prevent yellowing over time. Regular cleaning and protection will keep your shoes looking great. This care routine helps maintain their freshness.

### Troubleshooting Common Washer Shoe Cleaning Issues

Even with careful preparation, issues can sometimes arise when washing shoes. These problems can range from lingering odors to damage. Understanding common issues helps you react quickly. I have encountered several challenges during my own shoe washing experiences. Knowing what to do makes the process less stressful.

This section covers solutions to frequently met problems. We will discuss what to do if shoes still smell or if they appear damaged. Addressing these concerns promptly helps salvage your footwear. My goal is to provide practical advice for overcoming these hurdles. You can solve most problems with a few simple steps.

#### Shoes Still Smell After Washing

If your shoes retain an odor after washing, it means the bacteria causing the smell were not fully eliminated. This can happen with very ingrained odors. First, ensure the shoes dried completely. Dampness encourages bacterial growth and smell. You can sprinkle fresh baking soda inside the shoes again. Let it sit for 24-48 hours.

Another solution is to use a vinegar rinse. After a wash, you can lightly spray the inside of the shoes with a solution of white vinegar and water (1:1 ratio). Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then rinse with clear water. Ensure they dry completely afterward. For stubborn odors, a more intensive treatment with vinegar and baking soda can be found in this guide on [how to clean with vinegar and baking soda](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-with-vinegar-and-baking-soda). Sometimes, the insoles are the main source of odor; hand-washing or replacing them might be necessary.

#### Shoes Appear Damaged or Warped

Damage usually occurs from using incorrect wash settings or drying methods. If shoes warp, it often results from hot water or machine drying. Glues can melt, causing parts to separate. Unfortunately, once shoes warp significantly, it is hard to reverse the damage. For minor separation, shoe glue can sometimes help.

If parts like eyelets or small embellishments came off, you might be able to reattach them. For major structural damage, the shoes might be beyond repair. This highlights the importance of following the cold water, delicate cycle, and air-dry rules. Prevention is always better than trying to fix damage. My lessons learned here tell me never to rush the drying process.

#### Washing Machine Has a Bad Odor After Washing Shoes

Shoes, especially very dirty ones, can leave behind grime or odors in your washing machine. After washing shoes, always run a cleaning cycle for your machine. Use hot water and a cup of white vinegar or a machine cleaner. This flushes out any residue. This is similar to how you would clean other machine-washable items that might leave residue.

Wipe down the drum and rubber gasket of your washer immediately after the shoe cycle. Use a damp cloth to remove any visible dirt. Leaving the washer door ajar between uses helps prevent mildew buildup. This ensures your machine stays fresh and ready for your next laundry load. This step protects your appliance and keeps your clothes clean.

### FAQ Section

#### Can I wash all types of shoes in the washing machine?
No, not all shoes are suitable for machine washing. You can wash athletic shoes, canvas sneakers, and synthetic fabric shoes. Avoid putting leather, suede, silk, or embellished shoes in the washer. These materials can get damaged by water, heat, or agitation. Always check the shoe material before you start.

#### What detergent is best for washing shoes?
Use a mild liquid laundry detergent. Avoid harsh chemicals or powdered detergents. Powdered detergents may not dissolve fully and can leave residue on your shoes. A small amount, about half of a normal load, is usually enough. Liquid detergent rinses out more easily from shoe materials.

#### How often can I wash my shoes in the washer?
The frequency depends on how often you wear your shoes and how dirty they get. For heavily used athletic shoes, washing them every few months is reasonable. For casual shoes, once or twice a year might suffice. Over-washing can reduce their lifespan, so only wash when truly necessary.

#### What if my shoes still smell after washing?
Lingering odors usually mean bacteria remain or shoes did not dry completely. Sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit for 24-48 hours. You can also spray the insides with a vinegar and water solution, then rinse and air dry. Ensure complete dryness to prevent new odors.

#### Can I put my shoes in the dryer?
No, never put shoes in a machine dryer. The high heat can melt glues, shrink fabrics, and warp the shoe's shape. It can also damage your dryer. Always air dry shoes. Stuff them with paper towels to absorb moisture and maintain their shape, then place them in a well-ventilated area.

#### Do I need to remove insoles before washing?
Yes, it is best to remove insoles before washing shoes. Insoles can absorb too much water, making them hard to dry. They might also break down in the wash or trap odors. Hand-wash insoles separately or simply wipe them down. This ensures they dry properly and prevents mold.

### Conclusion

Cleaning shoes in the washer offers a simple, effective way to refresh your favorite footwear. By following the right steps, you can avoid damage and achieve great results. We covered identifying washable materials, essential preparation, and crucial machine settings. Remember to always use cold water, a delicate cycle, and mild detergent. The most important step for lasting results is careful air drying.

Proper care after washing also helps your shoes stay cleaner for longer. Regular spot cleaning and odor prevention are key. Now you have the knowledge to confidently clean shoes in the washer. Your shoes will look and feel fresh. Give this method a try and enjoy cleaner, longer-lasting footwear.
