## Keeping Your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro Clean

Your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro deep cleaner is a powerful tool for maintaining a fresh home. It removes pet stains and odors effectively. However, the machine itself needs regular cleaning. Dirt, hair, and dirty water can build up inside. This buildup affects performance and can lead to unpleasant smells. Learning how to clean Bissell Revolution Pet Pro components properly extends its life. It also ensures it cleans your carpets and upholstery perfectly every time. This article provides a comprehensive guide. We will walk you through each step of cleaning your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro.

### Takeaway

To ensure your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro performs optimally and lasts longer, regularly clean its essential parts. This includes:

*   Emptying and rinsing dirty water tanks after every use.
*   Removing and cleaning the brush rolls and nozzle.
*   Flushing the hose and attachments.
*   Inspecting and cleaning the filter.
*   Storing the machine properly.

Cleaning your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro involves disassembling key components, rinsing them thoroughly, and ensuring they are completely dry before reassembly. This process prevents odors, clogs, and maintains suction power.

### What is the simplest way to clean a Bissell Revolution Pet Pro?

The simplest way to clean your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is to disassemble its main components, including the dirty water tank, brush rolls, and nozzle. Rinse these parts with warm water. Remove any hair or debris. Allow all parts to air dry completely before putting the machine back together. This routine maintenance prevents odor and maintains cleaning efficiency.

## Why Regular Cleaning Matters for Your Bissell Deep Cleaner

Regular cleaning of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is very important. This machine handles dirty water, pet hair, and grime. If you do not clean it, these materials build up inside. This buildup causes problems.

First, dirty components can cause bad odors. These odors transfer back onto your carpets when you clean. This defeats the purpose of deep cleaning. Second, buildup can block passages and reduce suction. This makes the cleaner less effective at removing stains and dirt. A well-maintained machine cleans better and lasts longer. It helps you keep your home truly clean and fresh.

*   **Prevents Odors:** Residual pet hair, dirty water, and cleaning solution can become a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. These create strong, unpleasant smells that can then transfer to your freshly cleaned carpets. Regular rinsing and drying prevent this.
*   **Maintains Suction Power:** Clogs in the dirty water tank, hose, or nozzle reduce the machine's ability to pick up water and dirt. A clean machine maintains strong suction, ensuring better cleaning results.
*   **Extends Machine Lifespan:** Buildup can strain the motor and other internal parts. Keeping components clear of debris reduces wear and tear. This helps your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro last for many years.
*   **Ensures Hygienic Cleaning:** You want your carpets to be truly clean. A dirty machine cannot achieve this. Cleaning your Bissell ensures that you are removing dirt, not spreading it.

Think of it like any other appliance you use for cleaning. You clean your washing machine or dishwasher to ensure they work well. A carpet cleaner needs the same attention. It handles significant amounts of dirt and grime, especially with pets in the home. Giving it proper care ensures it remains a powerful tool for your home’s cleanliness.

## Essential Tools and Supplies for Cleaning Your Bissell

Before you start cleaning your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro, gather the right tools. Having everything ready makes the process smoother and faster. Most items are common household things. You do not need special equipment.

Here is a list of what you will need:

*   **Warm Water:** This is essential for rinsing all components. It helps loosen dirt and dissolve residue.
*   **Mild Dish Soap (Optional):** For stubborn grime, a tiny amount of dish soap can help. Use it sparingly and rinse very well. Do not use strong detergents.
*   **Microfiber Cloths or Old Towels:** These are for wiping down surfaces and drying parts. They absorb water well.
*   **Small Brush or Toothbrush:** Useful for scrubbing tight spots, grooves, and removing matted pet hair from brush rolls.
*   **Scissors or Pet Hair Removal Tool:** To cut and remove tangled hair from the brush rolls. Hair can wrap tightly around the bristles.
*   **Bucket or Sink:** For rinsing components under running water. A large sink works best.
*   **Gloves (Optional):** If you prefer to avoid direct contact with dirty water or cleaning solutions.

You might also consider having a designated area for cleaning. This could be a utility sink, a bathtub, or an outdoor space. A place where you can make a mess without worry is ideal. Ensure good ventilation, especially if any lingering odors are present. Remember, the goal is to get all parts thoroughly clean and dry. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they can damage plastic components or leave residues. Simple warm water is often enough for most routine cleaning.

For ongoing maintenance, keep these items handy. This way, cleaning your Bissell becomes a quick, easy task after each use. Regular, light cleaning is always better than tackling a huge mess later. Similar principles apply when you [clean a Bissell PowerFresh steam mop](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-bissell-powerfresh-steam-mop), where regular maintenance is key to long-term performance.

## Emptying and Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank

The dirty water tank is where all the extracted grime, pet hair, and dirty solution collect. It is perhaps the most important part to clean after every single use. Neglecting this step is the main cause of bad odors and poor machine performance. This tank holds what you have removed from your carpets.

The process is straightforward:

1.  **Remove the Dirty Water Tank:** First, turn off and unplug your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. Locate the dirty water tank, usually at the front or back of the machine. It often has a handle for easy removal. Press any release buttons or lift the tank straight up according to your model’s instructions.
2.  **Dispose of Contents:** Carry the tank to a sink or toilet. Pour out all the dirty water and any collected debris. You might see a shocking amount of pet hair, dirt, and grime.
3.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Use warm, running water to rinse the inside of the tank. Swish the water around to dislodge any residue. Pay attention to the bottom and sides, where sludge can settle.
4.  **Clean the Filter Screen:** Many dirty water tanks have a filter screen inside. This screen catches larger debris and pet hair. Remove it if possible, and rinse it under running water. Use a small brush or your fingers to remove any matted hair or dirt.
5.  **Wipe Down the Tank:** Use a cloth to wipe the interior and exterior of the tank. Ensure all surfaces are clean. If there is a persistent odor, you can add a small amount of warm water and a capful of white vinegar. Swish it around, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse again very well.
6.  **Allow to Air Dry:** This step is critical. Place the tank upside down, or in a way that allows air to circulate inside. Make sure it dries completely before reattaching it to the machine. Any remaining moisture can lead to mold and mildew growth.

Regularly emptying and cleaning this tank prevents the smell of stale, dirty water from permeating your home and machine. It is a quick habit that makes a big difference in your Bissell's long-term health and performance. Remember to clean this part every time you use your machine. This helps your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro work effectively.

## Cleaning the Brush Rolls and Nozzle Assembly

The brush rolls and nozzle are critical for cleaning performance. The brush rolls scrub your carpets, lifting dirt and hair. The nozzle sucks up the dirty water. These parts get very dirty and clogged with hair, especially with pets. Cleaning them is a must.

Here is how to clean them:

1.  **Access the Brush Rolls:** Turn off and unplug your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. Lie the machine on its side or back to access the bottom. On most Revolution Pet Pro models, you will need to remove the nozzle cover or brush roll window. This usually involves pressing release tabs or unscrewing a few screws. Consult your manual for exact steps.
2.  **Remove and Clean Brush Rolls:** Once exposed, gently pull the brush rolls out. They often have end caps that can be removed for easier cleaning. Use scissors or a pet hair removal tool to carefully cut and untangle all hair wrapped around the bristles. This is often the most time-consuming part.
3.  **Rinse Brush Rolls:** Rinse the brush rolls thoroughly under warm, running water. Use a small brush or your fingers to remove any remaining dirt or matted debris between the bristles. Ensure they are completely free of gunk.
4.  **Clean the Nozzle Assembly:** The nozzle is the clear plastic piece that sits over the brush rolls and vacuums up the dirty water. This part can also get clogged.
    *   Inspect the suction path for any blockages. Hair, threads, or large debris can get stuck here.
    *   Rinse the nozzle assembly under warm water. Use a small brush to clean inside the suction channel and any visible openings. Pay attention to the edges that meet the floor.
5.  **Clean the Brush Roll Window/Cover:** If your model has a removable clear window that covers the brush rolls, clean both sides of it. Dirt and streaks can build up, obscuring your view of the brushes.
6.  **Allow Parts to Dry:** Place all brush rolls, end caps, nozzle, and covers in a well-ventilated area to air dry completely. Do not reassemble while wet, as this encourages mold and mildew. This can take several hours, or even overnight.
7.  **Reassemble:** Once dry, carefully reassemble the brush rolls and nozzle parts back onto your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. Ensure everything clicks into place correctly.

Cleaning these components ensures optimal agitation and suction. This makes your deep cleaner effective at lifting pet hair and stains. Regularly cleaning these parts helps your Bissell machine perform as it should.

## Maintaining the Hose and Attachments

The Bissell Revolution Pet Pro often comes with a hose and various attachments for spot cleaning or upholstery. These tools are fantastic for targeted messes but can also harbor dirt, pet hair, and smelly residue. Cleaning them is just as important as cleaning the main unit.

Here is how to maintain them:

1.  **Remove Hose and Attachments:** After use, disconnect the hose from the main unit. Separate any attached tools, like the upholstery tool or crevice tool.
2.  **Flush the Hose:** Take the detached hose to a sink or bathtub. Hold one end under running warm water. Let the water run through the entire length of the hose until it comes out clear from the other end. You might see dirty water, hair, or debris flush out. If your model has a "Rinse Hose" feature, use that for internal flushing. For tough clogs, try running a small amount of clean water mixed with a capful of Bissell rinse formula through the hose, then flush with clear water.
3.  **Clean Attachments:** For each attachment, take it apart as much as possible. Many have removable clear covers or brush inserts.
    *   **Rinse:** Rinse all parts under warm, running water. Use a small brush or toothbrush to scrub away any trapped dirt, hair, or sticky residue. Pay attention to spray nozzles and suction openings.
    *   **Remove Hair:** Just like the main brush rolls, pet hair can wrap around brushes on attachments. Use scissors to cut and remove any tangled hair.
4.  **Inspect for Clogs:** Hold attachments up to the light to check for any blockages in the nozzles or suction paths. If you see one, try to dislodge it with a thin wire or pick.
5.  **Allow to Dry:** Lay all hose components and attachments out to air dry completely. Hanging the hose allows gravity to help drain any remaining water. Ensure everything is bone dry before storing them away. Storing wet components can lead to unpleasant smells and mildew growth.
6.  **Store Properly:** Once dry, reattach the hose to the machine or coil it neatly. Store all attachments in their designated spots on the cleaner or in a clean, dry area.

Regular cleaning of your hose and attachments ensures they are ready for the next spill. It also prevents cross-contamination. If you have cleaned a very soiled area with an attachment, a thorough cleaning ensures future uses are hygienic. Think about how you would clean a small handheld device, like when you learn [how to clean a couch with Bissell Little Green](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-couch-with-bissell-little-green); the process of cleaning the parts is very similar.

## Filter Care and Storage Tips

Filters are the unsung heroes of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. They protect the motor from dirt and debris. Proper filter care ensures your machine maintains strong suction and operates efficiently. Storing your machine correctly also prevents problems and keeps it ready for use.

### Cleaning the Filter

Your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro likely has one or more filters, usually located near the dirty water tank or motor.

1.  **Locate the Filter:** Refer to your user manual to find the exact location of the filter. It is often a foam filter or a pleated filter.
2.  **Remove the Filter:** Carefully remove the filter. It might twist out or simply pull out.
3.  **Clean the Filter:**
    *   **Foam Filters:** Rinse foam filters under warm, running water. Gently squeeze it to remove dirt. Continue until the water runs clear.
    *   **Pleated Filters:** These cannot be rinsed. Tap them gently over a trash can to dislodge dirt and dust. If heavily soiled, they might need replacement. Never wash a pleated filter unless the manual specifically says you can.
4.  **Dry Thoroughly:** This step is crucial for foam filters. Allow the filter to air dry completely, for at least 24 hours, before putting it back into the machine. A wet filter can damage the motor. Place it in a well-ventilated area.
5.  **Inspect and Replace:** Regularly inspect your filter for wear, tears, or permanent discoloration. Even with cleaning, filters degrade over time. Replace filters according to your manufacturer's recommendations, usually every 6-12 months, or sooner if you use your machine frequently. A clean filter ensures maximum airflow and protection for your motor.

### Proper Storage Tips

Correct storage is vital for the longevity of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro.

1.  **Ensure All Parts Are Dry:** Before storing, make absolutely sure every component – tanks, brush rolls, nozzle, hose, attachments, and filter – is completely dry. Storing a damp machine leads to mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors.
2.  **Empty All Tanks:** Double-check that both the clean water tank and dirty water tank are empty. Store them removed from the machine if your manual suggests it, or with lids slightly ajar to allow air circulation.
3.  **Coil Cords and Hoses Neatly:** Wrap the power cord neatly around its designated wraps on the machine. Coil the hose without kinks. Store attachments in their proper places or a storage bag.
4.  **Store Upright:** Store your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro upright in a clean, dry place. A closet, utility room, or garage corner are good options.
5.  **Avoid Extreme Temperatures:** Do not store the machine in areas with extreme heat or cold. Freezing temperatures can damage water pumps or tanks. Excessive heat can degrade plastic components over time.
6.  **Protect from Dust:** If storing for an extended period, consider covering the machine with a breathable cloth. This prevents dust accumulation.

Following these filter care and storage tips keeps your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro in top condition. This ensures it is always ready to tackle pet messes with full power.

## Deep Cleaning for Stubborn Odors and Buildup

Even with regular cleaning, sometimes stubborn odors or mineral buildup can occur in your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. This is especially true if you live in an area with hard water or have very frequent, large pet messes. A periodic deep cleaning can refresh your machine.

### Tackling Odors Inside the Machine

Persistent odors often come from residual bacteria or mold in hard-to-reach places.

1.  **Vinegar Rinse:** Fill the clean water tank with equal parts warm water and white vinegar. Run this solution through the machine as if you were cleaning a carpet. Make a few passes over a non-carpeted area, like a garage floor or utility sink, to flush the internal lines. Then, fill the clean tank with just warm water and run it through again to rinse the vinegar out.
2.  **Focus on Hard-to-Reach Areas:**
    *   **Hose Flush:** For hose-specific odors, use the vinegar solution method described above. Some models have a self-cleaning hose tool. Attach this tool and run clean water (or vinegar solution) through it for a few minutes.
    *   **Spray Nozzles:** Check the small spray nozzles where the cleaning solution comes out. If they are clogged, use a small pin or needle to carefully clear them.
3.  **Disinfect (Optional):** After cleaning, if odors persist, you can use a very diluted sanitizing solution specifically designed for carpet cleaners (check your manual for approved solutions). Run it through, then thoroughly rinse with clean water. Always follow product instructions for safety.

### Removing Mineral Buildup (Hard Water)

Hard water can leave mineral deposits in the internal components, especially the spray nozzles and pump.

1.  **Descaling Solution:** A white vinegar solution is also effective for descaling. Use the 50/50 water-vinegar mix in the clean water tank. Run this through the machine as described above. The vinegar helps break down mineral deposits.
2.  **Soak Removable Parts:** For parts like the nozzle assembly, if it shows visible mineral buildup, you can soak it in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water for 30 minutes. Then scrub with a brush and rinse thoroughly.
3.  **Inspect and Clean Spray Nozzles:** If the spray pattern becomes weak or uneven, mineral buildup in the nozzles is likely. You can use a small needle or toothpick to gently clear these. Be careful not to damage the nozzle.

**Important Note:** Always ensure thorough rinsing with clean water after using vinegar or any cleaning solution. This prevents residue buildup and protects your machine. Remember to allow all parts to dry completely before reassembling.

This deep cleaning helps your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro stay fresh.

## Troubleshooting Common Bissell Cleaning Issues

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues with your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. Understanding common problems and how to troubleshoot them can save you time and frustration. Many issues stem from inadequate cleaning or minor clogs.

### Issue 1: No Suction or Weak Suction

This is a frequent complaint and usually indicates a blockage.

*   **Check the Dirty Water Tank:** Ensure the dirty water tank is not full. A full tank will stop suction. Empty and rinse it.
*   **Inspect the Nozzle:** The clear nozzle on the bottom can get clogged with hair or debris. Remove it and clear any obstructions.
*   **Clean Brush Rolls:** Tangled hair around the brush rolls can impede suction, especially if it blocks the path to the nozzle. Remove and clean them thoroughly.
*   **Check the Hose and Attachments:** If using the hose, ensure it is not kinked or clogged. Flush it out as described previously.
*   **Verify Tank Seal:** Make sure the dirty water tank is seated correctly and sealed tightly. A poor seal can cause a loss of suction.

### Issue 2: No Spray or Weak Spray

If your machine is not dispensing cleaning solution, the spray nozzles might be blocked.

*   **Check Clean Water Tank:** Ensure the clean water tank has water and cleaning solution. Make sure it is properly seated.
*   **Inspect Spray Nozzles:** The small holes where the solution sprays can get clogged with mineral deposits or dried solution. Use a small pin or needle to gently clear them.
*   **Pump Issues:** If cleaning nozzles does not help, there might be a pump issue. This sometimes requires professional service. However, running a warm water and vinegar solution through the machine can sometimes clear minor pump clogs from hard water.

### Issue 3: Machine Emits Bad Odors

This is almost always a sign of dirty components.

*   **Thoroughly Clean Dirty Water Tank:** This is the primary culprit. Empty, rinse, and dry it completely after every use.
*   **Clean Brush Rolls and Nozzle:** Pet hair and dirty water residue can linger here.
*   **Flush Hose and Attachments:** Do not forget to clean the hose. It can trap a lot of smelly grime.
*   **Deep Clean with Vinegar:** If odors persist, perform a full deep clean as described in the previous section, using a vinegar solution to flush the internal system.
*   **Air Dry All Parts:** Always ensure all removable parts are completely dry before reassembling and storing.

### Issue 4: Leaking Water

Leaks can be concerning but are often easily fixed.

*   **Check Tank Seals:** Ensure both the clean and dirty water tanks are properly seated and their rubber gaskets are clean and intact. A small piece of debris on the gasket can cause a leak.
*   **Inspect Hoses and Connections:** Look for any visible cracks in the hoses or loose connections.
*   **Overfilling:** Do not overfill the clean water tank. Follow the fill lines.
*   **Damaged Parts:** If parts are visibly cracked or damaged, they may need replacement. Contact Bissell support for replacement parts.

Regular cleaning prevents most of these issues. Staying on top of maintenance saves you time and ensures your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is always ready to tackle the next pet mess.

## Maximizing Your Bissell's Lifespan with Best Practices

Beyond regular cleaning, adopting certain best practices can significantly extend the lifespan and performance of your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro. These habits ensure your investment continues to provide a clean home for years.

### Use Approved Cleaning Solutions

Always use Bissell-brand cleaning formulas specifically designed for their machines. These solutions are formulated to work with the internal components of your cleaner. Using off-brand or homemade solutions (other than simple vinegar rinses for descaling) can void your warranty. They can also cause foaming, leave residue, or damage the internal pump and seals. For example, some non-Bissell formulas might leave a sticky residue that attracts dirt faster.

### Pre-Treat Heavily Soiled Areas

Before using your Bissell, pre-treat heavy stains or pet accidents. Apply a suitable pet stain remover directly to the spot. Let it sit for a few minutes. This allows the solution to break down the mess. Then, run your deep cleaner over the area. This reduces the strain on your machine. It also improves overall cleaning effectiveness. It means less work for your Bissell.

### Vacuum First

Always vacuum the area thoroughly before deep cleaning. This removes loose dirt, pet hair, and large debris. Your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is a deep cleaner, not a vacuum. If you skip this step, hair and large particles will clog the dirty water tank, brush rolls, and nozzle. This makes the deep cleaner less efficient. It increases the frequency of cleaning the machine itself.

### Do Not Overfill Tanks

Always fill the clean water tank and the dirty water tank only to their marked "max fill" lines. Overfilling the clean water tank can lead to leaks. Overfilling the dirty water tank can cause it to overflow, leading to spills and potential damage to the machine's motor area. Following the fill lines helps prevent accidents and maintains proper operation.

### Store Properly When Not in Use

As discussed, ensure your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is completely dry before storing it. Store it in a clean, dry, climate-controlled environment. Avoid garages that get extremely hot or cold. Keeping it dust-free and dry prevents mold, mildew, and component degradation. This also keeps it ready for immediate use.

### Perform Routine Checks

Take a moment to check your machine regularly. Look for any visible cracks in hoses or tanks. Inspect the brush rolls for wear or damage. Listen for unusual noises during operation. Catching small issues early can prevent them from becoming major problems. These proactive steps ensure your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro remains a reliable part of your home cleaning routine.

## Conclusion

Cleaning your Bissell Revolution Pet Pro is not just a chore; it is an investment in your machine's longevity and performance. We have covered the essential steps, from regularly emptying the dirty water tank to meticulously cleaning the brush rolls, nozzle, hose, and filters. We also explored deep cleaning methods for odors and mineral buildup. Following these steps ensures your Bissell continues to tackle pet messes effectively.
