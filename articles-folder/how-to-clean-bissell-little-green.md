### Answering Your Query: How to Clean Bissell Little Green?

To clean your Bissell Little Green, immediately after use, empty and rinse both the clean and dirty water tanks. Detach and flush the hose, nozzle, and brush with clean water. Wipe down the machine's exterior. Ensure all parts air dry completely before reassembling and storing to prevent mold and mildew growth. This keeps your cleaner ready for its next task.

## The Importance of Cleaning Your Bissell Little Green

Keeping your Bissell Little Green clean is not just about hygiene. It directly impacts its longevity and performance. Dirty water, residue, and debris can accumulate inside the machine. This leads to blockages, reduced suction, and unpleasant smells. Imagine cleaning a fresh spill with a machine that smells like old dirty water. It defeats the purpose.

A well-maintained Bissell Little Green performs better. It effectively removes tough stains and refreshes surfaces. Clean components ensure proper spray and suction. This means your cleaning solution reaches the fibers and is fully extracted. This machine is a substantial investment. Regular cleaning protects that investment. It ensures you get the most out of your portable carpet cleaner for years to come.

Many people overlook cleaning the machine itself. They focus only on cleaning the surfaces. However, the machine handles a lot of dirt. It processes dirty water. Over time, this can lead to internal contamination. This can then transfer to the next surface you try to clean. I have seen machines develop a sour smell. This happens because dirty water sat inside the tank or hose. Taking a few minutes to clean it after each use prevents these issues. This simple habit keeps your cleaning efforts effective.

## Immediate Post-Use Cleaning: Essential Steps After Every Clean

After using your Bissell Little Green, immediate cleaning is crucial. This simple routine prevents dirt and residue from hardening inside the machine. It also stops mold and mildew growth, which can lead to foul odors. I always make sure to do this right after I finish a cleaning task. This prevents unpleasant surprises later.

First, you must empty the dirty water tank. Unclip the tank from the machine. Carry it to a sink or toilet. Pour out the dirty water. You will be surprised how much grime this small machine picks up. Next, rinse the dirty water tank thoroughly with clean, warm water. Swish the water around to dislodge any lingering debris or foam. I often use a soft bottle brush to reach corners. This ensures no residue remains. Rinse the tank until the water runs clear. This step is essential for preventing bad smells.

Then, focus on the clean water tank. Even if some solution remains, it is best to empty it. Rinse it with clean water. Old cleaning solution can become stagnant or sticky over time. This can clog the spray nozzle. After rinsing, leave both tanks open to air dry completely. This prevents moisture buildup, which is a prime environment for mold. Ensuring proper airflow is key to preventing mildew inside. Lay the tanks on a clean towel or drying rack. Make sure they are fully dry before storing them.

Finally, wipe down the exterior of the machine. Use a damp cloth to remove any splattered dirt or cleaning solution. Pay attention to the areas around the tanks and the base. This quick wipe-down keeps the machine looking clean. It also prevents dirt from transferring to your hands or storage area. This routine takes only a few minutes. It makes a big difference in the machine's upkeep.

## Deep Cleaning the Dirty Water Tank and Float Stack

The dirty water tank is where all the extracted grime ends up. It needs more than just a quick rinse. Over time, a film of dirt, dissolved grime, and even pet hair can build up on its inner surfaces. This film can create a persistent odor. It can also affect the tank's capacity or the float system. I often find myself deep cleaning this tank more than any other part.

To deep clean the dirty water tank, start by completely emptying it. As mentioned, rinse it thoroughly with warm water. For stubborn grime, you can add a small amount of mild dish soap to the tank. Fill it partially with warm water. Shake it vigorously to create suds and dislodge debris. Let it sit for a few minutes if the residue is particularly sticky. Then, scrub the inside walls with a long-handled bottle brush or a sponge. Ensure you reach all corners and crevices. Rinse until all soap residue is gone and the water runs clear.

Pay special attention to the float stack assembly. This is the part that prevents the tank from overflowing. It usually has a float that rises when the tank is full. This float mechanism can get gummed up with dirt and hair. Carefully remove any visible hair or debris from around the float. If your model allows, you might be able to disassemble the float mechanism. This allows for a more thorough cleaning. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to gently scrub around the float. Make sure it moves freely. A stuck float can cause your machine to stop suctioning prematurely.

After cleaning, allow the dirty water tank and float stack to air dry completely. You can place them upside down to drain excess water. Good airflow helps prevent mildew. Ensure no moisture remains before reattaching the tank to the machine. Proper drying is crucial for long-term storage and to prevent any lingering smells. A clean dirty water tank means your Bissell Little Green is ready to tackle the next mess without hesitation.

## Cleaning the Hose and Attachments: Preventing Clogs and Odors

The hose and various attachments are where much of the cleaning action happens. They directly come into contact with the dirtiest areas. This means they are highly prone to clogs and odor buildup. If you have ever noticed a strange smell coming from your Bissell Little Green, it often originates here. This section covers how I meticulously clean these vital parts.

To clean the hose, detach it from the main unit. This usually involves pressing a release button or twisting it off. Take the hose to a sink or bathtub. Hold both ends of the hose under running warm water. Allow the water to run through it for several minutes. This flushes out any remaining dirty water, hair, or carpet fibers. I sometimes add a small amount of non-foaming cleaner or just plain warm water to the clean tank and run it through the hose briefly. This simulates a cleaning cycle but with clean water. This helps push out any stubborn residues. If you are dealing with persistent odor, a mix of water and a small amount of white vinegar can help. [Vinegar is a great natural cleaner](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-with-vinegar).

The cleaning tools and attachments also need attention. Each attachment, whether it's the standard nozzle or a specialized brush tool, can collect grime. Disconnect all attachments from the hose. Rinse them thoroughly under running warm water. Use an old toothbrush or a small cleaning brush to scrub away any visible dirt, hair, or gunk from the brush bristles and suction openings. Pay particular attention to the nozzle's suction slot. This area is critical for effective water extraction. Hair and debris can easily get lodged here, reducing suction power.

For tools that have brushes, make sure to remove any wrapped hair or tangled fibers. If the bristles are removable, take them off for a more thorough clean. After rinsing, let all attachments and the hose air dry completely. You can hang the hose over a shower rod or lay it straight to ensure proper drainage. Do not store the hose coiled if it holds moisture. This can trap dampness and lead to mildew. Ensuring all parts are dry prevents the growth of odor-causing bacteria and mold. Proper care of these parts means your Little Green is always ready to tackle tough stains with full power.

## Maintaining the Spray Nozzle and Suction Opening

The spray nozzle and suction opening on your Bissell Little Green are critical for its performance. The nozzle delivers the cleaning solution, and the suction opening extracts the dirty water. If these areas are clogged or dirty, your machine cannot clean effectively. A weak spray or poor suction means your efforts are wasted. I make sure to check these parts every time I clean my machine.

To clean the spray nozzle, first, ensure the machine is unplugged. The spray nozzle is often integrated into the handheld cleaning tool. Look closely at the tiny holes or slit where the cleaning solution comes out. Over time, these can get clogged with dried cleaning solution or mineral deposits from water. If you notice a weak or uneven spray, this is likely the culprit. You can use a small, thin object, like a straightened paperclip or a needle, to gently clear any blockages from these holes. Be careful not to damage the nozzle. Never use anything that could scratch or enlarge the opening.

The suction opening is the wide slot on the cleaning tool that vacuums up the dirty water. This area frequently collects pet hair, lint, and other debris from the surface being cleaned. After each use, visually inspect this opening. Remove any visible hair or large pieces of debris. You can use your fingers, a pair of tweezers, or a damp cloth to wipe it clean. For more stubborn grime, use a soft brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub the inside of the suction path. Ensuring this path is clear allows for maximum suction power. This is vital for removing as much moisture as possible from your carpets or upholstery. Efficient water removal helps prevent spots from reappearing and shortens drying times.

After cleaning both the spray nozzle and suction opening, rinse the entire attachment under warm water. This helps flush out any loosened debris. Give the attachment a final shake to remove excess water. Then, allow it to air dry completely before reattaching it to the hose or storing it. A clean spray nozzle ensures an even distribution of cleaning solution. A clear suction opening provides powerful extraction. These simple steps ensure your Bissell Little Green operates at peak efficiency. This helps keep your home looking its best.

## Drying and Storing Your Bissell Little Green: Preventing Mold

Proper drying and storage are just as important as the cleaning process itself. Skipping these steps can undo all your cleaning efforts. It can lead to mold growth, mildew odors, and potential damage to the machine. My routine always includes careful drying. This helps my Bissell Little Green stay fresh and ready.

After you have cleaned all the individual components—the tanks, hose, attachments, and the main body—it is essential to allow them to air dry thoroughly. Do not rush this step. Moisture trapped inside the machine or its parts is the primary cause of mold and mildew. These can produce a very unpleasant smell. This smell can then transfer to the surfaces you are trying to clean. Leave the clean and dirty water tanks disconnected. Place them in an area with good air circulation. You can also place them upside down to allow any residual water to drain out completely.

Hang the hose vertically if possible. This helps water drain out from the length of the hose. If hanging is not an option, lay it straight on a clean, dry surface. Ensure there are no kinks or coils that could trap water. The attachments should also be placed on a clean towel or drying rack. Allow several hours for all parts to dry. For best results, I often let them dry overnight. You can even use a small fan to speed up the drying process. Just avoid direct heat, which could warp plastic components.

Once everything is completely dry, reassemble the Bissell Little Green. Store it in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing it in damp environments like basements or garages without proper ventilation. These areas can encourage mold growth even on dry equipment. A closet or a utility room is usually a good choice. Keeping the machine in a dry place helps maintain its internal components. It also ensures it does not develop musty smells. Proper storage ensures your Bissell Little Green is always ready to tackle the next mess, smelling fresh and working efficiently. This detailed drying and storage approach extends the life of your appliance significantly.

## Troubleshooting Common Cleaning Issues and Odors

Even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues like persistent odors or reduced performance. These problems often indicate a deeper buildup or a specific component needing attention. Addressing them promptly keeps your Bissell Little Green in top working order. I have dealt with these issues myself and can offer solutions.

A common complaint is a foul odor emanating from the machine. This usually means mold or mildew is growing inside. This happens when water and residue are left in the tanks, hose, or attachments. If your machine smells, even after routine cleaning, you might need a deeper sanitization. Try running a tank of plain hot water through the machine. You can also add a small amount of white vinegar to the clean water tank. Vinegar is excellent for [removing mold and odors](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-mold-in-shower). Run this solution through the hose and attachments as if you were cleaning. Then, run a tank of plain water to rinse everything out. After this, ensure every part is completely air-dried as described in the previous section.

Another issue is weak suction or spray. Weak spray often points to a clogged spray nozzle. As mentioned before, use a small needle or paperclip to clear the tiny holes. If the suction is weak, first check the dirty water tank. Ensure it is not overfilled or that the float mechanism is not stuck. Next, inspect the hose and suction tool opening for blockages. Hair, lint, or dried solution can significantly reduce suction. Clear any visible obstructions. Sometimes, the problem is with the seal around the dirty water tank. Make sure the tank is securely latched in place. A loose tank allows air to escape, reducing suction power.

For stubborn clogs in the hose, consider running a long, thin pipe cleaner or a flexible brush through it. If the machine simply won't spray, ensure the clean water tank has water and solution. Check that it is seated correctly. Also, make sure the pump filter is not clogged. Some models have a small filter near the pump. Refer to your user manual for its location and cleaning instructions. These troubleshooting steps address most common performance issues. Regular maintenance and a thorough cleaning routine prevent these problems from occurring. This ensures your Bissell Little Green remains a reliable cleaning companion.

## Extending the Life of Your Bissell Little Green with Proper Care

Beyond cleaning, several practices help extend the overall lifespan of your Bissell Little Green. These tips focus on how you use and handle the machine. They complement your cleaning routine. I always make sure to follow these guidelines to get the most out of my appliances.

Firstly, always use the recommended Bissell cleaning solutions. While it might be tempting to use generic cleaners or household products, these are not formulated for your machine. Non-Bissell solutions can create excessive foam, clog the spray nozzle, or damage internal components. They may also leave sticky residues that attract more dirt. Using the correct solution ensures optimal cleaning. It also protects the machine's pump and spray system.

Secondly, avoid running the machine dry. Always ensure there is sufficient cleaning solution in the clean water tank before you start cleaning. Running the pump without liquid can cause it to overheat and wear out prematurely. If you notice the spray becoming weak or stopping, check the clean water tank immediately. Refill it if necessary. This simple awareness protects the pump, which is a critical component of the machine.

Thirdly, store the machine in a safe environment. As previously mentioned, a cool, dry place is ideal. Avoid storing it in areas where it could freeze or be exposed to extreme heat. Freezing temperatures can damage the pump and crack plastic components. High heat can also warp plastic. Keep the machine upright to prevent any residual water from leaking out. Protect it from dust and direct sunlight.

Finally, handle your Bissell Little Green with care. Avoid dropping it or bumping it against hard surfaces. While it is a portable machine, rough handling can damage internal wiring, seals, or the motor. Periodically check the power cord for any fraying or damage. If you notice any issues, discontinue use and contact Bissell for repair or replacement parts. Following these common sense practices helps ensure your Bissell Little Green provides effective cleaning for many years. Regular use combined with proper care makes all the difference.
