## Revive Your Kicks: How to Clean New Balance Suede Shoes

Your New Balance suede shoes feel great. They look stylish, adding a unique touch to your outfit. But over time, dirt and stains appear. Suede is a delicate material. It needs special care to keep its look. Knowing **how to clean New Balance suede shoes** properly helps them last longer.

Many people struggle with cleaning suede. They worry about damaging the soft texture. I understand this concern completely. This guide provides clear, easy steps. We will cover routine cleaning, tackling tough stains, and protecting your shoes. You will learn the right tools and methods. By the end, your New Balance suede shoes will look fresh again. Get ready to restore your favorite footwear.

### Takeaway

*   **Gather Tools:** Use a suede brush, eraser, and cleaner for best results.
*   **Dry Clean First:** Remove loose dirt with a brush before any wet cleaning.
*   **Spot Treat Stains:** Address specific marks with a suede eraser or specialized cleaner.
*   **Deep Clean Gently:** Use minimal moisture and specific suede cleaners for thorough cleaning.
*   **Dry Properly:** Air dry away from heat, and never use direct heat.
*   **Protect Regularly:** Apply a suede protector spray to guard against future stains and water damage.

To clean New Balance suede shoes, begin by brushing off dry dirt with a suede brush. For marks, use a suede eraser. Apply a specialized suede cleaner with a soft cloth for deeper stains, then dab it dry. Allow the shoes to air dry completely, and finish by brushing the nap.

## Understanding Suede Material and Its Needs

Suede is a unique leather material. It comes from the underside of animal skin. This gives it a soft, napped surface. This fuzzy texture makes suede popular for shoes. New Balance uses suede in many popular styles. These shoes offer comfort and style.

The soft texture also makes suede prone to dirt. Dust, mud, and liquids easily stick to its fibers. Unlike smooth leather, you cannot just wipe suede clean. Water can leave marks. Harsh chemicals can ruin the nap. This is why proper cleaning methods are important. You need gentle tools and specific products. Understanding suede's nature is the first step in successful cleaning.

### Why Suede Needs Special Care

Suede's fibers are short and open. They absorb liquids and dirt quickly. This absorption leads to stains. When water dries on suede, it can leave a dark spot. This is because the water pulls dirt to the surface. Traditional shoe cleaners are too harsh for suede. They can strip its natural oils. This makes the suede stiff or discolored.

My own experience confirms this. I once used a regular wet cloth on a small dirt patch. It created a bigger, darker water stain. I learned my lesson. You must use methods designed for suede. This ensures you maintain the fabric's soft feel. It also protects the color and lifespan of your New Balance shoes. Special care prevents permanent damage.

## Essential Tools for Cleaning New Balance Suede Shoes

Before you start cleaning, gather your tools. Having the right equipment makes a big difference. Using improper items can harm your suede shoes. A dedicated suede cleaning kit is often the best choice. These kits contain items specifically designed for suede.

I always recommend having these tools on hand. They are worth the small investment. They ensure your New Balance suede shoes stay in top condition. You can find these items at shoe stores or online. Preparing your workspace is also smart. Lay down newspapers or a towel. This keeps your area clean during the process.

### The Right Suede Brush

A good suede brush is crucial. It has bristles made of brass wire, nylon, or crepe rubber. Each type serves a slightly different purpose. Brass bristles are good for tougher dirt. Nylon bristles are softer for general cleaning. Crepe rubber lifts deep-set dirt and restores the nap.

I use a brush with both wire and rubber sides. This allows me to tackle different cleaning needs. Always brush in one direction. This helps lift the nap and remove dirt. Avoid scrubbing back and forth. That can flatten the suede fibers. A proper brush is your first line of defense against dirt.

### Suede Eraser or Rubber Block

A suede eraser looks like a large pencil eraser. It is made of special rubber or crepe material. This tool helps remove scuffs and light stains. It works by gently rubbing the dirt off the suede fibers. This action lifts the dirt without damaging the material.

I find these erasers very effective for daily wear marks. You just rub the eraser over the dirty spot. The dirt transfers onto the eraser. Then, you can brush off the eraser crumbs. This method is dry and very safe for delicate suede. It is a must-have for quick fixes.

### Suede Cleaner Solution

For tougher stains, you need a specialized suede cleaner. These solutions are usually foam or liquid. They are formulated to clean suede without causing water spots. Always choose a cleaner designed for suede. Do not use regular soap and water.

I prefer a cleaner that comes with an applicator brush. This ensures even distribution. Follow the product instructions carefully. Most require a small amount applied to a cloth. Then, you gently dab the stained area. These cleaners lift deep-set dirt and grime effectively.

### Microfiber Cloths and Water

Soft microfiber cloths are useful for applying cleaners. They also help blot away moisture. Avoid using colored cloths. The dye could transfer to your shoes. Keep a bowl of clean water nearby. You might need it to lightly dampen a cloth.

Remember, less water is more for suede. Use water sparingly. You want to dampen the cloth, not soak it. This prevents over-wetting the suede. I always have a few clean cloths ready. They are great for dabbing and drying.

## Pre-Cleaning Steps for Your New Balance Suede Shoes

Starting with preparation makes cleaning easier. These steps remove loose dirt. They also identify areas needing more attention. Skipping these steps can spread dirt. It makes the deep cleaning process less effective.

Take your time with these initial steps. They lay the groundwork for a successful clean. A well-prepared shoe is easier to clean. It also reduces the risk of damage. I make sure my shoes are completely dry before starting. Wet dirt is harder to remove.

### Removing Loose Dirt and Debris

First, remove any loose dirt. Use your suede brush for this. Brush gently in the direction of the nap. Start from the top of the shoe. Work your way down to the sole. This pushes dirt away from the suede.

I lift the laces to get to hidden spots. Pay attention to seams and crevices. Dirt often hides in these areas. For really caked-on mud, let it dry first. Then, you can gently tap the shoes together. This breaks off larger clumps. After this, use your brush again.

### Dealing with Dried Mud and Light Scuffs

Dried mud requires a gentle approach. Do not pick at it. Allow the mud to dry completely. Then, use your suede brush. Use the firmer bristles if your brush has them. Brush the mud away from the surface. Be gentle to avoid damaging the suede.

For light scuffs, grab your suede eraser. Rub the eraser over the scuff mark. Use short, gentle strokes. The friction lifts the scuff. The eraser also helps restore the nap. After using the eraser, brush away any residue. This prepares the suede for the next step.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Deep Cleaning New Balance Suede Shoes

Once pre-cleaning is done, you can deep clean. This step addresses tougher stains and overall grime. Follow these instructions carefully. Remember, suede is delicate. Patience and gentle methods are key.

I find breaking down the process into small steps helpful. This ensures I do not miss anything. It also keeps me from rushing. Deep cleaning your New Balance suede shoes is a rewarding process. The results speak for themselves.

### Targeting Stubborn Stains with a Suede Cleaner

For stubborn stains, use your specialized suede cleaner. Read the product instructions first. Most cleaners require you to apply a small amount to a clean microfiber cloth. Do not apply the cleaner directly to the suede. This can create a concentrated wet spot.

Gently dab the stained area with the damp cloth. Work from the outside of the stain inwards. This prevents the stain from spreading. Do not rub aggressively. The goal is to lift the stain, not push it deeper. Allow the cleaner to work for a few minutes. Then, use a dry part of the cloth to blot the area.

### Handling Water Stains on Suede

Water stains are common on suede. They happen when water dries unevenly. To fix them, lightly dampen a clean microfiber cloth with water. You want it damp, not wet. Gently wipe the entire affected area of the suede. This aims to re-wet the suede evenly.

After re-wetting, use a dry cloth to blot. Press firmly to absorb excess moisture. You want the suede to dry uniformly. As it dries, it should look consistent. I have used this method many times. It helps minimize the appearance of water spots. This technique helps restore the suede's original look.

### Addressing Oil and Grease Stains

Oil and grease stains are tricky on suede. Act fast for the best results. Sprinkle cornstarch or talcum powder directly on the fresh stain. These powders absorb oil. Let the powder sit on the stain for several hours, even overnight. It needs time to soak up the grease.

After the powder has absorbed the oil, gently brush it away. Use your suede brush. If a faint mark remains, you can try a specialized suede degreaser. Apply it carefully following product directions. This method has saved some of my favorite New Balance suede pairs.

## Drying and Restoring the Nap of Your Suede Shoes

Proper drying is as important as proper cleaning. Incorrect drying can ruin your suede. It can make the suede stiff or misshapen. Restoring the nap brings back the soft, fuzzy texture. This step ensures your New Balance shoes look their best.

I always emphasize air drying. This is the safest method. It might take some time, but it is worth it. Rushing the drying process can cause permanent damage. Patience is key.

### Air Drying Your New Balance Suede Shoes

After cleaning, let your shoes air dry completely. Do not use direct heat sources. This means no hair dryers, radiators, or direct sunlight. Heat can shrink the suede. It can also make it brittle and hard. Stuff your shoes with paper towels or shoe trees. This helps maintain their shape.

Paper towels also absorb moisture from the inside. Replace them if they become damp. Let the shoes dry in a cool, well-ventilated area. This usually takes several hours. For heavily cleaned shoes, it can take a full day. I always allow ample drying time. This ensures the suede dries evenly.

### Restoring the Suede Nap

Once the shoes are fully dry, it is time to restore the nap. The cleaning process might have flattened the suede fibers. Use your suede brush. Brush the suede in multiple directions. Use short, gentle strokes. This lifts the fibers. It brings back the soft, plush texture.

I often use the rubber side of my brush for this. It gently coaxes the fibers back into place. Brush until the suede looks uniform. You will notice the color and texture improve. This final brushing step makes a big difference. It helps your New Balance suede shoes look fresh and new.

## Advanced Care and Protection for Your New Balance Suede

Beyond cleaning, proactive care helps maintain your suede shoes. Protection prevents future damage. Regular maintenance extends their lifespan. These advanced steps keep your New Balance suede shoes looking great for longer.

I consider protection an essential part of owning suede. It saves time and effort in the long run. A protected shoe is much easier to clean. It also resists common everyday wear.

### Applying a Suede Protector Spray

A suede protector spray creates a barrier. This barrier repels water and stains. Always apply it to clean, dry suede. Hold the can about six to eight inches from the shoe. Spray an even coat over the entire suede surface. Do not saturate the shoe.

Let the first coat dry completely. Then, apply a second light coat. This ensures full coverage. I reapply protector spray every few months. This keeps the protective layer strong. It is the best defense against new stains. This simple step can save your shoes from many mishaps.

### Storing Your Suede Shoes Properly

Proper storage protects your suede from dust and deformation. Keep your New Balance suede shoes in a cool, dry place. Avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight can fade the suede color. Use shoe trees to maintain their shape. Cedar shoe trees also absorb moisture and odors.

If storing for a long time, use dust bags. These bags protect against dust and light. They also allow the suede to breathe. Avoid storing suede in plastic bags. Plastic can trap moisture. This can lead to mold or mildew growth. I always store my suede shoes carefully. This preserves their condition between wears.

### Regular Maintenance and Spot Cleaning

Regular maintenance keeps minor issues from becoming major problems. Brush your New Balance suede shoes after every few wears. This removes dust and light dirt. It also keeps the nap looking fresh. This quick habit prevents dirt buildup.

Address spills and stains immediately. The faster you act, the easier it is to remove the stain. Carry a small suede eraser for quick spot fixes. This proactive approach saves your shoes from deep-set stains. It also means less intense cleaning later on.

## Common Suede Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid

Knowing what *not* to do is as important as knowing what to do. Many common cleaning mistakes can permanently damage suede. Avoiding these pitfalls protects your New Balance shoes. I have made some of these mistakes myself. I want to help you avoid them.

Learning from errors saves your valuable footwear. Always double-check your methods. Use proper tools and products. This section highlights the biggest dangers. Pay close attention to these warnings.

### Using Harsh Chemicals or Soaps

Never use harsh chemicals on suede. This includes laundry detergents, dish soaps, or strong household cleaners. These products are too aggressive. They can strip the suede's natural oils. This leads to dryness, stiffness, and discoloration. They can also leave residues.

I once tried a mild dish soap on a small spot. It left a dark, crusty patch. Suede needs specialized, gentle formulas. Stick to products made specifically for suede. Your New Balance shoes will thank you.

### Washing Suede Shoes in a Machine

Putting suede shoes in a washing machine is a definite no. The machine's agitation and water temperature can cause severe damage. Suede will shrink, stiffen, and lose its texture. The machine can also pull the shoe apart.

While some shoes can be cleaned in a washer, suede is not one of them. For instance, you might learn [how to clean shoes in the washer](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-shoes-in-the-washer) for canvas sneakers. But for suede, this method is destructive. Always hand clean suede. This ensures careful and controlled cleaning.

### Over-Wetting the Suede

Suede and excessive water do not mix. Over-wetting can lead to stubborn water stains. It can also cause the suede to stiffen as it dries. Use minimal moisture when cleaning. A damp cloth is enough. Do not soak the suede.

When I apply a cleaner, I always use a cloth. I never pour liquid directly onto the shoe. This keeps the moisture controlled. Blotting is always better than rubbing. This helps absorb moisture without pushing dirt deeper.

### Drying Suede with Heat Sources

As mentioned before, avoid direct heat for drying. Heat can permanently damage suede fibers. It can cause cracking or shrinking. The suede will lose its soft feel. Always air dry your shoes in a cool, well-ventilated place.

Patience is crucial during the drying process. Let the shoes dry naturally. Stuffing them with paper towels helps. It also keeps their shape. Resist the urge to speed up drying. This simple caution protects your suede.

## Addressing Specific New Balance Suede Shoe Stains

Beyond general cleaning, specific stains need targeted approaches. Different substances interact with suede differently. Knowing the right method for each stain type is crucial. This helps prevent permanent damage.

I have dealt with many types of stains on my own shoes. Each required a slightly different strategy. These tips come from practical experience. They offer solutions for common mishaps.

### Removing Gum from Suede

Gum stuck to suede can be frustrating. Do not pull it off. This can tear the suede fibers. Instead, place ice in a plastic bag. Hold the bag over the gum. Let the gum freeze and harden completely. This makes it brittle.

Once frozen, you can gently chip it off. Use a dull knife or the edge of a credit card. Be very careful not to cut the suede. After removing the large pieces, use a suede brush. Brush away any small remnants. This method is effective and safe.

### Cleaning Salt Stains

Salt stains often appear in winter from road salt. These look like white crusty marks. Mix a small amount of white vinegar with water. Use a ratio of one part vinegar to two parts water. Lightly dampen a clean cloth with this solution.

Gently dab the salt stains. The vinegar helps dissolve the salt. Do not saturate the suede. Blot the area with a dry cloth afterward. Let it air dry. If marks remain, repeat the process. This method helps restore the suede's color.

### Tackling Ink Stains

Ink stains on suede are very difficult. Act quickly for the best chance. Try a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab. Dab the ink stain very gently. Do not rub, as this can spread the ink. Work from the outside of the stain inwards.

This method can lighten the stain. It might not remove it completely. For tougher ink stains, a professional suede cleaner might be needed. I have found ink to be one of the most challenging stains to remove from suede.

## Maintaining the Inside of Your New Balance Suede Shoes

Cleaning the outside of your shoes is important. But do not forget the inside. The interior of your New Balance shoes can accumulate dirt, sweat, and odors. Maintaining the inside improves comfort. It also prevents smells.

I always take time to clean the shoe interior. It extends the freshness of my shoes. A clean inside contributes to a clean outside. It is part of complete shoe care.

### Cleaning Insoles and Linings

Remove the insoles if they are removable. You can often hand wash them with mild soap and water. Scrub them gently with a brush. Rinse them thoroughly. Let them air dry completely before putting them back. For non-removable linings, use a damp cloth. Mix a small amount of mild soap with water. Lightly wipe the inside fabric.

You can also use a mixture of vinegar and baking soda to address odors, though be careful not to apply this directly to suede. For shoe interiors, a light spray or dab works. For general shoe interior cleaning, you can also refer to guides like [how to clean the inside of shoes](https://homeessentialsguide.com/how-to-clean-the-inside-of-shoes). This approach targets sweat and grime buildup. It helps keep your shoes fresh.

### Eliminating Odors from Suede Shoes

Odors often come from bacteria. Sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes. Focus on the toe and heel areas. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda absorbs odors. In the morning, shake out the excess powder.

Another method is to use cedar shoe trees. Cedar wood naturally absorbs moisture and odor. You can also place dryer sheets inside the shoes overnight. For a deeper odor treatment, consider a shoe deodorizer spray. This keeps your New Balance shoes smelling fresh.

## When to Seek Professional Suede Cleaning

Sometimes, a stain is too tough. Or you might feel unsure about cleaning valuable shoes. That is when professional help is a good option. Shoe repair shops often offer suede cleaning services. They have specialized tools and expertise.

Knowing when to call a professional saves your shoes. It prevents accidental damage. Professionals can handle stains that are too old or too deep. They can also restore severely damaged suede.

### Identifying Beyond Repair Stains

Some stains are simply too set. Oil or ink stains that have dried for a long time might be permanent. Attempting to remove them yourself can cause more damage. If you have tried home methods multiple times without success, consider it beyond your ability.

Excessive scrubbing can thin the suede. It can also change its color. If the suede has lost its nap and looks matted, it might be too far gone. A professional can assess the damage. They can tell you if a full restoration is possible.

### Benefits of Professional Suede Cleaning

Professionals have access to industrial-grade cleaners. They also have specialized equipment. This equipment can clean suede more deeply. It can also restore the nap more effectively. They understand different types of suede. This reduces the risk of damage.

A professional cleaning can extend the life of your shoes. It can also restore their original appearance. They often offer re-protecting services too. This adds another layer of defense. It is an investment in your footwear.

## Final Tips for Long-Term New Balance Suede Shoe Care

Caring for your New Balance suede shoes is an ongoing process. Regular attention helps them last. These final tips summarize a complete care routine. They ensure your shoes remain a cherished part of your wardrobe.

I always integrate these practices into my shoe care. They are simple habits. They yield great results. Consistency is key when dealing with suede.

### Establish a Cleaning Schedule

Do not wait until your shoes are very dirty. Establish a regular cleaning schedule. For daily wear, a quick brush once a week is good. Deep clean as needed, perhaps once a month or every few months. This prevents dirt from setting in.

I check my shoes for new marks after each wear. Addressing small issues right away makes cleaning easier. A consistent schedule maintains the shoes' appearance. It also prevents the need for drastic cleaning measures.

### Invest in Quality Suede Products

High-quality suede cleaning products make a difference. Cheap alternatives might contain harsh chemicals. They can damage the suede. Invest in a good suede brush, eraser, and cleaner. A quality protector spray is also vital.

These products are formulated for delicate suede. They clean effectively without causing harm. They ensure your cleaning efforts are safe. They also yield better results.

### Know When to Rest Your Suede Shoes

Suede shoes are not meant for every weather condition. Avoid wearing them in heavy rain or snow. Moisture is suede's enemy. If they get wet, let them dry naturally. Do not force dry them.

Rotate your footwear. Do not wear the same suede shoes every day. This allows them to air out. It also prevents excessive wear and tear. Having different shoes for different conditions extends the life of all your footwear.

Cleaning New Balance suede shoes might seem daunting at first. However, with the right tools and techniques, it becomes a simple process. We covered everything from basic dry brushing to tackling tough stains. We also explored crucial drying and protection methods. Remember to use specialized suede products. Avoid harsh chemicals and machine washing. Proper air drying is vital. And always protect your suede with a quality spray.
