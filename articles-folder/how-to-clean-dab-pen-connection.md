It takes only a few seconds but makes a big difference. This simple step is the most effective preventative measure. It stops sticky wax from hardening into stubborn clogs.

### Store Your Pen Upright

Storing your dab pen upright prevents liquid concentrates from leaking. When a pen lies flat, residual oils can drip down into the connection. An upright position keeps gravity on your side. This simple storage tip keeps the atomizer and battery connections cleaner. It also prevents leaks in your bag or pocket.

### Do Not Overfill the Atomizer

Overfilling is a common cause of leaks and buildup. Always fill your atomizer just below the maximum line. Excess concentrate can bubble over during heating. It then seeps into the threads and contact points. Proper filling technique minimizes this overflow. It ensures your material stays where it belongs.

### Use Quality Concentrates

The quality and consistency of your concentrates matter. Very sticky or runny concentrates can be more prone to leaking. Higher quality, well-purified concentrates may leave less residue. While not always possible, choosing better quality can help. This reduces the amount of material that can get into the connection.

### Regular Deep Cleaning Schedule

Even with daily wipes, a deeper clean is occasionally necessary. Establish a routine for thorough cleaning. This might be once a week or every couple of weeks, depending on your usage. Mark it on your calendar if it helps. A scheduled deep clean catches any buildup missed by quick wipes. This proactive approach keeps your dab pen running smoothly.

### Consider a Pen with Better Design

Some dab pens are designed with features that reduce connection issues. Look for models with sealed atomizers or improved airflow. These designs can minimize leakage into the connection. If you are in the market for a new device, research models known for easy maintenance. A well-designed pen can make cleaning less frequent.
